# ![printf](https://github.com/Eduu19/42-project-badges/raw/main/badges/ft_printfe.png) FT_Printf!

The "ft_printf" project at Ã‰cole 42 is a programming task that challenges students to recreate a simplified version of the printf function from the C language. The printf function is used to print formatted text in a C program and is one of the most commonly used functions in C programming. The goal of the "ft_printf" project is to enable students to develop a deep understanding of the formatting specifications of the printf function and how it operates internally.
